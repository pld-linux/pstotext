- update pstotext to ghostgum's (libgs API author) version:

 * Changelog since 1.8g
 Version 1.9 is a modification of 1.8h to recognise excessive space in
  "ashow" as being a word separator, as found output from groff 1.08.
  Also fixed widthshow, awidthshow and added xshow, yshow and xyshow.
  Uses ANSI prototypes.  These are now required, not optional.
  Fixes a number of compiler warnings.
  Note that neither of the original authors still work at DEC/Compaq/HP.
